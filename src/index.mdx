# Futureswap Docs

Futureswap [FS] is a protocol that can be considered a hybrid between Bitmex and Uniswap where it uses automated market making for perpetual futures. There are 3 actors in the system:

**1. Liquidity Providers [LP]:** LP's provide liquidity to the platform in equal value amounts per exchange. For example if they wanted to add value to an ETH/DAI pool they'd add $100 of ETH and $100 of DAI. They are minted liquidity tokens similarly to Uniswap. LP's can redeem liquidity at any time if their liquidity is not in a trade. They will ideally be receiving the trade fees for allowing traders to use their liquidity. They will also be earning FST which is the native governance token as an added incentive.

**2. Traders:** Traders can open Long or short positions at a leverage >1 and <=20 times their collateral.

**3. Liquidators:** Liquidators monitor the platform for positions that are close to violating margin requirements. They recieve an adjustable fee for sending this transaction in. They do not need to include any value with this transaction as they do not have to take over the trade. The trade is just closed.
